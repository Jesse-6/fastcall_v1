# fastcall_v1

System V ABI fastcall macro toolkit (64-bit) - for fasm2 assembler

This enables one to call functions in a very similar, although not equal, C style looking format.
To use it, just copy '.inc' files to the include path under [fasm2](https://github.com/tgrysztar/fasm2 "flat assembler 2") assembler, and include it in your projects.
Examples are provided, and, together with my 'lazy written' user guide, might help one getting started.
I also include in this package my multi level anonymous label macro, which has a self explanatory application inside those example files, too.
